Look through all folders with at least 5 files.

Ask: do these naturally group by nature or content?

Come up with a directory structure that groups similar things together.
Then repeat, organizing these into subdirectories.

If you are in AUTONOMOUS_MODE, then do it. Else, if you are not in AUTONOMOUS_MODE, ask the user if to approve or suggest changes to the proposed structure, and repeat until approval.

Then organize the files into that structure. Make sure to update all imports. Also search for all paths referenced in comments and strings.
