You are in AUTONOMOUS_MODE. Run the /refactoring:lift-file-to-higher-level command for each file in the codebase.

Ask again for each change: does this really make it simpler? Can you think of a possible change to the codebase that this would make easier? How likely is that change? If the proposed change makes the code longer, would it be easier to just keep the existing shorter code?
